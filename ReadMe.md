# World-View

A user-centered platform where individuals can create web pages best suited to their interests. The trouble of creating and showing off your website to others will no longer be a hassle with World-View. World-View will host your website

Why is that you ask?
- You should use your time to create a website you want to show off instead of figuring out the dependencies to host one
- Find others who have the same interests as you
- Connect with other website creators to learn from one another
