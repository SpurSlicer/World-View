Meeting 1 - 3/20

Fixes:
Make sure that user stories are in "As a user..." form
Break down user stories into smallest units of work
Since user stories are individual features, they have a front and back end component (no "database" user story)

Questions:
Are there security risks involved with giving people access to other websites?
- Other sites should be read only; you can only edit your own sites
Are there any copyright issues?
- May need some sort of content moderation, but this is probably beyond the scope of the project
How much flexibility do users have with making their webpage?
- Users can only make a static site using HTML/CSS/JS

TODO:
Brainstorm more features and refine project scope

Feature ideas:
- Friends list
- Chat room
- DMs with individual users
- System for "liking" other websites
- Tutorial page (maybe when sharingc their site, the creator has an option to make a mini blog post about how they made it)
