Meeting 1 - 3/20

Fixes:
Make sure that user stories are in "As a user..." form
Break down user stories into smallest units of work
Since user stories are individual features, they have a front and back end component (no "database" user story)

Questions:
Are there security risks involved with giving people access to other websites?
- Other sites should be read only; you can only edit your own sites
Are there any copyright issues?
- May need some sort of content moderation, but this is probably beyond the scope of the project
How much flexibility do users have with making their webpage?
- Users can only make a static site using HTML/CSS/JS

TODO:
Brainstorm more features and refine project scope

Feature ideas:
- Friends list
- Chat room
- DMs with individual users
- System for "liking" other websites
- Tutorial page (maybe when sharingc their site, the creator has an option to make a mini blog post about how they made it)
- Tag system for websites with a searchbar to search sites by tag
- Let users view code of other sites

Meeting 2 - 4/03
Minutes-4/3/2024
Make sure to make individual feature branches while you work on features and move it to main when finished
Describing app - we provide the user a text editor with basic html code, button that says view website, users make individual website

B- from what i understand you have a hash and a drive like file storage that is secure

B- through this website the user will be able to showcase their code?
G-Less to do with code review, this is mostly intended as a general space for users to post their websites, users are able to share and see other users code through dms, we can add a more educational or coding help related section if we have time.
B-how is it different from a typical portfolio website?
G-Different in the sense that you have complete control over a whole webpage rather than just a portfolio, you could make anything you want in that webpage from personal notes to a portfolio if you want to. (has greater potential than a simple portfolio website)
G- It could very well be expanded in the future, we could add a tag system to help identify what goal or purpose a user’s website
B- These are all good but they are just time promises, what can we guarantee we will do
J-We will def implement tag system
W-We can add tag pretty easily
B-it looks like a portfolio website still, adding a learning component might make it better for the users and stand out as different
J- we have the chatrooms that allow users to talk to eachother and thusly allows for code collaboration

G-Database implementation is going well, have some good backend set up, currently focused on structuring.(sorry didnt catch all of it)
J-Working on drive API integration right now - running into trouble gaining permissions but a workaround has been found and code is partially implemented but not quite complete
I- done with docker setup with working usernames password and login feature, as well as the
A- written up the user acceptance testing as well as working on navbar with James, we are in the process of narrowing down what we want for the navbar, and this should be complete by end of week.
The wireframe is already complete and is pretty barebones but should provide a basis.
W-I made a navbar and created a bunch of files as a scaffolding but did not fill most of them in. Aside from that I have asked about color schemes and aesthetics from our group so I can start making a nice layout. Also sorry I also have not been on top of user story's. I am going to start on the displays for various things in the future like the friend chat log.

Any challenges?
Yes but theyve been worked through
Overall note - make sure to update user stories and epics more consistently
